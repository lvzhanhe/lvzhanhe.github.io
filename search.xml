    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Some parts are paraphrased from zyBooks whose copywrite belong to the original writer. Computer programA computer program consists of instructions (aka statements) executing one at a time. Basic instruction types are input, process,output. A sequence of instructions that solves a problem is called an algorithm. In a program, the cause of a problem is called a bug, and troubleshooting is called debugging. Debugging technics: Visual inspection Inserting debug output statements Hierarchical debugging (divide code into several parts) ScannerIf a method needs to read user input, a good practice is to create a single Scanner object in main() and pass that Scanner object to the method. 123456789public static void readWord(Scanner scnr) &#123; String word = scnr.next(); // Do something with the word&#125;public static void main(String [] args) &#123; Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in); readWord(scnr);&#125; ObjectsPrinciples of Object-Oriented Programing: abstraction, encapsulation, modularity. In a program, an object consists of some internal data items plus operations that can be performed on that data. A reference refers to an object and may be thought of as storing the memory address of an object. Variables of a class data type (and array types) are reference variables. The new operator allocates memory for an object, then returns a reference to the object’s location in memory. A statement like TimeHrMin travelTime; declares a reference to an object of type TimeHrMin but not yet refer to a valid object. In the following case, variables timeRoute1 and timeRoute2 both refer to valid objects and variables timeRoute1 and bestRoute refer to the same object. 123456DriveTime timeRoute1 = new DriveTime();DriveTime timeRoute2;DriveTime bestRoute;timeRoute2 = new DriveTime();bestRoute = timeRoute1; Primitive and reference typesJava variables are one of two types: A primitive type variable directly stores the data for that variable type, such as int, double, or char. int num = 20; A reference type variable refers to an object. Integer num = 10; Primitive wrapper classes are built-in reference types that augment the primitive types. Two ways to initialize primitive wrapper class: Object initialization style: Integer num = new Integer(81); Double num = 0.0; A new memory allocation occurs every time a new value is assigned to an Integer variable, and the previous memory location to which the variable referred, remains unmodified. A primitive wrapper object (as well as a String object) is immutable. That means a programmer cannot change the object via methods or variable assignments after object creation. For instance, Number = 28; does not change the value in Number’s object. Instead, the assignment allocates a new Integer object with value 28, returns a reference to that new object, and assigns the reference to variable Number. The original Integer object remains unchanged. Using the equality operators on two reference variables will evaluate whether each operand refer to a same object. However, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;= compare values of objects. Use equals() (return boolean) and compareTo() (return a number) methods for primitive wrapper types. The Integer, Double, and Long primitive wrapper classes provide methods for converting objects to primitive types: num.intValue(), num.doubleValue(), num.longValue(), c.charValue(), b.booleanValue(). Strings and numeral systems: 12345num.toString()Integer.toString(num) // static method, don't need to create an objectInteger.parseInt(str) // Returns int valueInteger.valueOf(str) // Returns Integer objectInteger.toBinaryString(num1) // e.g. returns "1001" Final: When a variable is declared with final keyword, it’s value cannot be modified, essentially, a constant. If a reference is declared as final, it cannot be changed to refence others. ArrayListAn ArrayList is an ordered list of reference type items. 12import java.util.ArrayList;ArrayList&lt;String&gt; studentNames = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); Several ArrayList methods： add(element) or add(index element) get(index) set(index, element) A position should already have a value before set. remove(index) size() isEmpty() clear() After arrayList.clear(), arrayList.get(0) is an invalid access. An ArrayList’s index must be an integer type but not a floating-point type, even if 1.0, 2.0 etc. We can utilize method chaining to make code more readable MemoryDoing insertions/removes on large ArrayLists can take a very long time. Appending a new item to the end of a 100 element ArrayList requires 0 elements to be shifted. Inserting a new item at the beginning of a 100 element ArrayList requires 100 elements to be shifted. Static memory: static fields which are allocated once and last for the whole duration of a program’s execution with their addresses being unchanged. The stack (automatic memory): A method call adds local variables to the stack, and a return removes them. The heap (free store): It’s where new operator allocates memory for objects. The Java virtual machine keeps a count, known as a reference count, of all reference variables that are currently referring to an object. If the reference count is zero which means that no variables in the program refer to the object right now, then the object is considered as an unreachable object. So it is eligible for garbage collection. Anything in the heap: When we run out of references to the object, then it can be garbage collected. Anything in the stack: When they go out of scope. Static field in a class: These will be in scope throughout your program. ClassSince main() is a static method, it does not have direct access to the class’ instance members. Instead, it should create an object first. Member access operator: operator . Mutator: setter Accessor: getter, which should not modify private data. A private helper method typically helps public methods carry out their tasks thus cannot be called from main(). A class creator can overload a constructor by defining multiple constructors differing in parameter types. this can also be used in a constructor to invoke a different (overloaded) constructor. 123public className() &#123; this(1, 1);&#125; In general, many programmers recommend only printing the fails when testing a class. A programmer don’t need to test all possible values when testing a class because it’s impossible. Running an existing class whenever code is changed is known as regression testing. We do this because the change may cause other problems which didn’t happen before. Abstract data types (ADT)Encapsulation: information hiding The String and ArrayList are examples of ADTs. Since they are part of the Java Class library, programmers do not to access the actual Java code in order to use it. Instead, they typically rely on other information describing an ADT’s public member method signatures. Java docThe Javadoc tool parses source code and specially formatted comments to generate API. @author: the author of the whole class @version: the version number of the class @param: params of a method @return: returned value or object of a method @see: reference to orther source Exceptiontry block exits immediately when a throw statement executes. finally follows all catch blocks (will execute even if no exception be catched). Use excpt.getMessage() to get error message. If an exception is thrown within a method and not caught within that method, then the method is immediately exited. checked exception: An exception that should be handled via try-catch or the throwing method must specify that the appropriate exception type may be thrown by appending a throws clause to the method’s definition. unchecked exception: an exception that due to hardware or logic errors and don’t need to be handled FileNotFoundException must be thrown by a fileReader’s constructor. InheritanceSuperclass: base class Subclass: derived class The members of a derived class can access the public members of the base class, but not the private members. Access specifier protected provides access to derived classes and other classes in the same package but not by anyone else. Overriding differs from overloading. In overloading, methods with the same name must have different parameter types. In overriding, a derived class member method takes precedence over base class member method with the same name and parameter types. The annatation @Override is optional but helps the compiler detect errors better. Object class will be the base class for classes that do not have a superclass. toString() of Object class returns a String containing the name of the class of which the object is an instance of with the object’s hexadecimal address in memory (hashcode). equals(otherObject) of Object class returns whether two variables refer to a same object. Constructor in subclass will call super() first, which is different from orther regular methods. PolymorphismPolymorphism refers to determining which program behavior to execute depending on data types. Compile-time polymorphism: the compiler determines which of several identically-named methods to be called based on the method’s arguments Runtime polymorphism: the determination is made when the program is running. E.g. a collection of objects of both base and derived class types Any object has two types associated with it. It has its display type and an implementation type. IntegerArrayBag a = new SafeIntegerArryBag(); Its type is IntegerArrayBag but it’s implemented as a SafeIntegerArrayBag. InterfaceAn interface specifies a set of methods that an implementing class must override and define. 123public interface pen &#123; // ...&#125; Any class that implements an interface must: List the interface name after the keyword implements Override and implement the interface’s methods A class can implement multiple interfaces using a comma separated list although a class can only inherit from only one superclass. An interface cannot be instantiated. An interface contains method declarations, as opposed to method definitions. Each of the primitive wrapper classes (e.g., Integer, Double) implements the Comparable interface, which declares the compareTo() method. Methods declared by an interface must be overridden and defined by the implementing class.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Intelligent virtual assistant]]></title>
    <url>%2F2017%2F11%2F04%2FIntelligent-virtual-assistant%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Intelligent virtual assistant, also known as conversational interfaces, digital assistants, or chat bots, enables people to converse with a machine in a dialogic fashion, using natural language. It works wherever there is digital-based communication. Some popular virtual assistants like Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Now assistant, are highly appreciated by users for their efficiency and multifunction. In this essay, I will introduce how to make a virtual assistant become intelligent, by mentioning its conversation engine architecture and supporting technologies. Three types of tasksFirst of all, the virtual assistant should clearly classify what kind of task it is facing. From general knowledge to specific, we divide conversations which intelligent virtual assistant will tackle into three types. The first type is a general conversation. There is no specific objective during a general conversation, just like a chit-chat. Most users carry out such form of conversation for fun, or in other words, to pass their time. The second type is about information and answers. It generally contains just one turn, a question, and an answer. The objective of this kind of conversation is providing information. The last one is task-oriented dialogue. For instance, when one walks into a grocery store, the salesclerk will ask the customer a series of purposeful questions. “What can I get for you?” “Anything else?” “Do you have a loyalty card?” This conversation ends until the customer gets what he or she wants. These three skills above are three of the most important skills we have in researching man-machine conversations. Pattern matchersThere are complicated architectures inside an intelligent virtual assistant. The way called “pattern matchers” is the simplest one to produce output according to input. Intelligent virtual assistant can learn from the internet. It first scans on the internet. Then extract pairs of sentences to form its own corpus. After creating its own knowledge system, when a sentence is entered, the virtual assistant will match this sentence to what it got from the internet. The highest matched sentence will be the key to find the response. Such way is sometimes efficient but is kind of stock and may give us some ambiguous returns. To value and optimize each answer, we have algorithms and neural networks. AlgorithmsTo execute the process algorithmically, one or a set of equations are needed. Every sentence in the corpus now has been classified to one certain class. When a sentence is entered, according to each word, a score will be assigned to a class. This score is different in different situations.For instance, personal pronouns like “I”, “you”, “we”, or prepositions like“in”, “on”, “at” has fewer weights than some words which have real meaning. The class who holds the highest value will be taken into account after a series of calculations. A lot of conversation engine now make use of this classification method. However, the logic issue is a huge obstacle to overcome. When there is a word “not” in the sentence, the conversation engine will be confused about what this negation refers to. Then causing disorder in the process of assignment of scores. Thus, a score does not mean probability but how well the question and answer match. Neural networkArtificial neural network is the most efficient and intelligent way to produce the output because it is a non-linear learner. It is a form of connectionism which inspired by biological neural networks of animal brains, invented in 1940’s. Multiple level artificial neural networks exists between the input layer and the output layer. One kind of common neural network is called Convolutional Neural Network. It appears like a small window, each window intercepts a certain amount of information, and extracted out to do convolution. Each term of convolution returns a value, which will be used for further computation. Another common neural network is 2D Convolutional Neural Network. Different from the first one, in 2D Convolutional Neural Network, the small window slides and intercepts information in a 2D range. The third one is Recurrent Neural Network. It refers to the process of a sequence of strings. The output of any position is restricted by information in the position of the previous position or the previous state, which is called hidden state. It helps predict the input probability of each word. Multi-turn conversationWhen a virtual assistant is dealing with a multi-turn conversation, the engine will no longer focus on the current input. What it does is to keep track of what user said previously. Thus, every sentence will be encoded. Then each code will reflect the information of the entire sentence. The engine interprets the input by using Attention model. Attention model helps the answer-generation process go with the target and helps the engine better understand the user. Technologies today have made the virtual assistant much more intelligent. Intelligent virtual assistant has reached to a wide range of users and been applied to different fields. Scientists are still working hard in order to bring it more fantastic features.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Web Crawler in Python]]></title>
    <url>%2F2017%2F08%2F07%2FWeb-Crawler-in-Python%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Search engines like Google, Bin, and Yahoo have become an irreplaceable tool of human life today. They filter information and retrieve data, helping people find what they want. However, it is not so familiar to people how search engines work. Actually, the main part of them is web Crawler (also called Spider), which is heavily used in today’s technologies. They are used to get specific information on web pages and do further operations. Why python?As we can find, nowadays, most of web crawlers are based on Python. Lots of people may be curious about why it is Python. Actually, other languages like PHP, Java, C++, can also implement similar functions. However, Python has many advantages over them. First of all, Python has great HTTP libraries and HTML parsers. A basic one used to do this is “request”. An advanced one is “Beautiful Soup” (Mike 06), which is designed as a top of popular Python parsers like lxml. Furthermore, there are a lot of useful frameworks off the shelf. For instance, Tornado can support the I/O (input or output) from being blocked. Besides, Scrapy is a good one to build a scalable and distributed crawler. These will make developing period easier and more efficient. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that Python is a good choice for developing a web crawler. How does it work?The basic mechanism of web crawler is not complicated. Web crawler scans the web, reading specific data which has been set previously. It may start with some popular sites which have higher hits. Then it can spread through the internet by finding the related link within the sites. The crawler turns its finding to a giant index (Paul 05). In this giant index, it contains a great deal of data which meet requirements. A case in point, when a word “engineer” is entered in a search engine, it will check the whole index, then provide items related to “engineer”. Web crawler scan the web regularly to make sure its information is up to date. It sounds like an easy process. However, in order to acquire and then provide both accurate and reliable information, there are further steps to do (Vural 03). Web crawler should not only know what they get, but should also recognize where they get this data. It is extremely vital in practical application. For instance, a word appears in “heading” is more appropriate that which appears in “context”. For another, when one search in a video website, it will return particular information like name, singer, album. These are all related staff surrounding key words. Besides, there are always complicated algorithms based on the content of index. Essentially, these are equations to value and rate results coded by programmers. How to make a crawler?A python editor and a python environment are required to encode and implement a crawler program. Basically, the module called urllib is used to open a link in python program and return a HTML file.( Wael 03) The argument is just like page = urllib.request.urlopen(url, data, timeout). Initialing a variable for the link is recommended, since there are always further algorithms on it. The first parameter is the link, the second parameter is data need to be transported in this process, the final one is setting timeout. After that, the main task is to find useful information in that file. For example, specific data can be found by locating specific label name. The argument is like start_link = page.find(“&lt;span class = ‘title’&gt;”). Sometimes the data found just used to print in a python console. In order to be printed friendly, some small changes should be replaced. For instance, &lt;br&gt; should be replaced with &lt;\t&gt;. However, sometimes the data need to be stored in local file system by using the function urllib.urlretrieve() and a loop if necessary. In some dynamic websites, the data need to be transported to another page, like login page (Kristopher 05). At this point, there are two data transfer functions called get and post. For the function get, it transfers the data by creating a new url containing the data. And for the function post, it transfers by creating a dictionary containing different parameters. What’s it used for？Apart from the search engine mentioned in the beginning, there are a great number of projects can be achieved by using web crawler. There is an interesting example given by Emily L, a graduate student at Harvard University. Some programmers used web crawler to dig out what is the most common time for people to sleep. Since most people would like to post something like “I need to sleep” before they get to bed, the web crawler will scan through Twitter how many times the word “sleep” appeared in successive time intervals. Then it stores the data and presents it friendly as a diagram.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Terminal provides a command line interface to control the UNIX-based operating system. Here’s something important you need to know about Terminal, and what it can do for you. pwdpwd is short for “print working directory”. It outputs the path of your current working directory. If you get lost, pwd can tell you where you are. 12➜ ~ pwd/Users/LyuZhanhe lsThe ls command outputs the names of all of the folders and files in the working directory. ls is short for “list” (as in “list” the contents). Folder names end with a /, file names do not. Some terminals also add colorized output to ls to denote different types of files. For instance, Mimir’s terminal has folders in blue, and files in white. 1234➜ ~ lsApplications Music PublicDesktop PhpstormProjects DownloadsDocuments Pictures iCloud Drive ls -l -R Desktop: List all the files on the desktop. -l, -R are parameters, and also can be written as -IR. -l means including details like permissions, owner, file size. -Rmeans including its subdirectories. You can find more parameters here. ls d**: List all the files whose names begin with ‘d’. ls -a: Show hidden files. cdThe cd command is short for “change directory”. It allows you to change your working directory to some different folder. cd ../: Go up one level. 123➜ ~ cd Desktop➜ Desktop cd ../➜ ~ mkdirmkdir [dir name]: Create a new directory. mkdir -p dir_1/dir_2: ‘p’ is short for parent. If dir_1 exists in your current working directory, create dir_2 in it. If not, create dir_1, then create dir_2 in it. 12345➜ Desktop mkdir test➜ Desktop mkdir test/test1➜ Desktop cd test➜ test lstest1 mkdir -m 777 dir_3: Create a directory named ‘dir_3’. It can be read, write and execute by any user. mkdir -m [xxx] dir_4: The first digit represents the owner, the second represents the group and the third represents other users.
